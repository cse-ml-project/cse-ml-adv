### Pandas  
http://pandas.pydata.org/ 
pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
pandas is a NUMFocus sponsored project. This will help ensure the success of development of pandas as a world-class open-source project, and makes it possible to donate to the project.

## Tensorflow - Linux 환경 구성
TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.

### tf 설치
설치 링크  
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/  

1. docker - 격리된 환경에서 수행
```
sudo apt-get install docker  
docker run -it gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow bash  
```

2. native pip
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev  
pip3 install tensorflow  
```

3. validation 수행
```
import tensorflow as tf  
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')  
sess = tf.Session()  
print(sess.run(hello))  
```

```
import tensorflow as tf
tf __version__
```

```
# Create a constant op 
# This op is added as a node to the default graph 
hello = tf.constant("Hello, TensorFlow!") 

# start a TF session 
sess = tf.Session() 

# run the op and get result 
print(sess.run(hello))
```

```
node1 = tf.constant(3.0, tf.float32) 
node2 = tf.constant(4.0)  # also tf.float32 implicitly 
node3 = tf.add(node1, node2)

sess = tf.Session()
print("node1:", node1, "node2:", node2) 
print("node3: ", node3)

print("node3:", node3)
print("sess.run(node3):", sess.run(node3))

```
